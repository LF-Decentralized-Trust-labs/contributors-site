# Getting Started with Open Source at LFDT

Do you want to start contributing to open source and need help figuring out where to begin?

---

## Introduction

Open source is more than just a way of building software — it’s a philosophy that promotes collaboration, transparency, and community. By sharing code openly, developers from all over the world can contribute their skills, knowledge, and creativity to projects used by millions of people every day.

The open source movement has changed how we create, share, and innovate. Whether you’re a seasoned programmer or just starting out, open source provides an incredible opportunity to learn new skills, work with like-minded people, and make a difference in the world.

In this guide, you’ll learn how to get involved in open source within the **Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust (LFDT)** community, the knowledge you need to contribute, and how to become part of this amazing ecosystem.

---

## Join the Community

Most LFDT projects have a website or GitHub repository with information on how to contribute. They also use communication channels such as:

- Mailing lists  
- Forums  
- Chat (Discord, Matrix, etc.)  
- Issue trackers  

These allow contributors to ask questions, report issues, share ideas, and propose solutions. Always follow the community guidelines and etiquette when using these channels. Being respectful and courteous is essential for collaboration.

---

## Understanding “Community”

LFDT communities are built on **collaboration, inclusivity, and diversity**. They are living and evolving entities that expect:

- Respectful and courteous behavior  
- Awareness of cultural differences  
- Patience, empathy, and helpfulness  

Professional conduct is also important:

- Follow the project’s Code of Conduct  
- Adhere to coding standards  
- Contribute well-tested and documented work  
- Be open to feedback and criticism  

---

## Choose a Project

When starting out, select a project that matches your skills and interests. Within LFDT, some flagship projects include:

- **[Hyperledger Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/)** – an open-source Ethereum client under Apache 2.0, written in Java.  
- **[Hyperledger FireFly](https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/)** – a “Supernode” stack enabling enterprises to build secure Web3 applications via APIs and orchestrated workflows.  
- **[Hiero](https://hiero.org/)** – the LFDT project name for the Hedera codebase, governed under vendor-neutral stewardship.  

Tips for choosing:

- Explore documentation and issue trackers  
- Look for issues labeled *good first issue* or *help wanted*  
- Start with tasks that build confidence and familiarity  

---

## Understand the Project

Before contributing, **use the project**:

- Follow tutorials and getting started guides  
- Experiment with features  
- Identify pain points and possible contributions  

This helps you provide valuable feedback and understand the project’s architecture and goals.

---

## Read the Documentation

Most projects provide a README and contribution guide. Invest time in:

- Reading docs, mailing lists, and forums  
- Reviewing open/closed issues and PRs  
- Understanding goals, culture, and values  

This makes your questions more informed and your contributions more valuable.

---

## Learn the Language of the Community

The open source world can feel overwhelming with acronyms and jargon. Use resources such as glossaries and don’t hesitate to ask questions. Communities are generally welcoming to learners.

---

## Start Small

Look for small, well-scoped tasks:

- Fix typos or documentation gaps  
- Update examples or tests  
- Address beginner-friendly issues  

Starting small builds confidence and trust.

---

## Collaborate with Others

Open source thrives on collaboration:

- Review others’ code  
- Provide constructive feedback  
- Test changes and report results  

Contributing doesn’t require permission — once you see where you can help, dive in and engage.

---

## Asking for Help

It’s okay to ask questions if you’ve made an effort first (read docs, try the software). When asking:

- Be specific and project-focused  
- Avoid asking for someone to “do the work for you”  
- Seek feedback instead of solutions  

This shows respect for maintainers’ time and builds stronger relationships.

---

## Code Contributors

If you’re contributing code, you should know:

- **Programming languages** – pick a project matching your skills  
- **Testing frameworks** – understand unit and integration testing  

---

## Non-Code Contributors

Not technical? You can still contribute:

- **Documentation** – write or improve docs, tutorials, blog posts  
- **Design** – create graphics, logos, UI/UX improvements  
- **Translation** – localize documentation or interfaces  

---

## Understanding Git, Pull Requests, and Issues

These tools form the backbone of contribution workflows:

### Git
Version control for tracking changes and collaborating. Learn basics via guides like *GitHub’s Getting Started*.

### Issues
Track bugs, features, or tasks. Look for labels like *good first issue* or *help wanted*.

### Pull Requests
Propose changes for review and merging. Code reviews are a learning opportunity, not personal criticism. Remember that reviews may take time due to async communication and time zones.

---

## Security Basics: SSH Keys & 2FA

Security matters:

- **SSH keys** – secure repo access without passwords  
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** – adds extra login security  

GitHub now requires 2FA for contributors. Learn more in [GitHub’s docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa).

---

## LFDT Resources

- **LFDT Contributor Ladder Task Force** – guidance on governance, contributor growth, and best practices  
- **LFDT Mentoring Initiatives** – resources and mentorship for newcomers  
- **LFDT Labs** – an entry point for early ideas and experiments  
- **LFDT Training & Webinars** – opportunities to upskill in decentralized trust technologies  

---

## Why Projects Need Contributors

LFDT projects depend on new contributors for growth and sustainability. By joining:

- You enhance your skills and network  
- You contribute to tools that impact the world  
- You give back to the community  

---

## Conclusion

Contributing to open source is a rewarding journey.  
Start small, collaborate openly, and respect the community.  

Good luck on your path to becoming an LFDT contributor!
