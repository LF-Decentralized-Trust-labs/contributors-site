# Contributing as an End User

End users are some of the most important contributors to the LF Decentralized Trust (LFDT) ecosystem.  
By adopting LFDT projects in production, sharing feedback, and documenting real-world use cases, end users help guide the direction of our community and validate its impact in the world.  

As a first step, we encourage all organizations actively using LFDT projects to add themselves to that project’s `adopters.md` file. This helps demonstrate adoption, build confidence for new users, and showcase the global reach of LFDT technologies.

## LFDT End User Community

The LFDT End User Community offers a vendor-neutral environment for forward-thinking organizations to:

- **Influence the technologies they rely on** by providing feedback directly to project maintainers and governance groups.  
- **Connect with peers** to exchange lessons learned, platform strategies, and best practices.  
- **Amplify their stories** by documenting adoption and participating in case studies or blogs.  

Together, end users help ensure LFDT projects remain relevant, interoperable, and enterprise-ready.

## End User Definition

An LFDT End User is an organization that **utilizes decentralized trust technologies internally** to build, deploy, and operate software applications, systems, or services.  

End Users **do not** include:  

- Companies that engage in the direct commercial distribution, support, or sale of software generated by LFDT projects.  
- Companies that sell or commercially distribute other products or services (e.g., identity, security, interoperability tooling) that enable, host, optimize, monitor, or secure LFDT technologies.  
- Training providers who sell courses, educational content, or professional certifications related to LFDT technologies.  
- Consultancies and system integrators.  

> ✅ **Note:** Contributing plug-ins, integrations, or extensions back to LFDT projects does *not* disqualify an organization from being an LFDT End User.  

Exceptions may be approved by LFDT on a case-by-case basis, particularly where commercial activity is incidental or de minimis.
