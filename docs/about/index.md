# About

Welcome to the **LF Decentralized Trust (LFDT)** Contributor's Site — a one-stop guide to using, contributing to, and maintaining LFDT projects. This site collects contributor ladders, maintainer playbooks, governance templates, mentorship paths, and end-user contribution guidance under a single, vendor-neutral roof.

!!! tip "New here?"
    If you’re not sure where to start, visit **[Getting Started with Open Source at LFDT](../contributors/start.md)** or **[Contributing as an End User](../end-users/index.md)**. Adoption and feedback are high-impact contributions.

## Contributor Ladder Task Force

The **Contributor Ladder Task Force** (CLTF) stewards community health across LFDT by helping projects **build, scale, and retain** contributor communities. Our focus areas include people-centric governance, contributor experience, communications, operations, and the tools/processes that support them. We aim to help projects grow flourishing, sustainable communities throughout the LFDT project lifecycle.

**What we do**
- Publish guidance on contributor ladders, roles, and pathways
- Offer best practices for governance and project operations
- Coach projects on community growth, recognition, and retention
- Maintain resources and templates that projects can copy and adapt

!!! info "Want to collaborate with the CLTF?"

    Open an issue or PR on this site, or reach out via the LFDT community channels listed in project docs.
