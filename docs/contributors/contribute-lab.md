# Start in LFDT Labs

Have an early idea, a proof‑of‑concept, or a single‑org codebase you want to grow in the open? **LFDT Labs** is designed for exactly that. It’s a welcoming space to explore, build community, and iterate—while keeping a clear path to promote into a **Top‑Level Project (TLP)** when the time is right. This page explains the spirit of Labs and points to the official documents you’ll need.

## Why choose Labs?

Labs is low‑friction and collaborative. You keep moving quickly—public repo, basic governance, and open conversations—while signaling your intent to grow under LFDT’s umbrella. Labs is ideal when you’re still validating scope, expanding beyond a single organization, or lining up the security, testing, and documentation practices that mature projects expect.

## What makes a strong Labs proposal

Tell the story of what you’re exploring and who’s with you:

*Problem and intent.* What are you trying to prove or learn? How does this idea fit within LFDT’s mission and the wider ecosystem? Keep it clear and grounded.

*People and energy.* Who are the initial maintainers? Are there partners or early users who want to experiment with you? Labs values momentum and curiosity.

*Next steps in the open.* Describe what you plan to do over the next few months—issues to tackle, releases to try, and how you’ll invite contributors. Good hygiene (license, CONTRIBUTING, DCO/CLA approach) helps new folks join in.

When you’re ready, use the **official template** so reviewers can move fast: <https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust/project-proposals>.

## How evaluation works

Labs entries are lightweight but intentional. Reviewers look for a meaningful problem statement, an open repo, and signs that a community can form around the work. Labs is not a dumping ground—it’s the beginning of a journey toward Incubation and, eventually, Graduation once the lifecycle criteria are met.

## The journey: share → experiment → grow → promote

Start by sharing your idea with the community—Discord, mailing lists, and related projects. File your **Labs proposal** via the template, then experiment in public: ship small releases, write docs, welcome contributors, and compare notes with neighboring projects. As momentum builds and multi‑org participation grows, you’ll be ready to propose promotion into **Incubation** under a TLP.

## Stay connected

Labs works best when it’s social. If you’re still shaping the idea, come meet the people who can help—maintainers, product folks, and researchers across the ecosystem.
