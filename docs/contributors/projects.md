# LFDT Projects

!!! draft<br>
    All projects of the LF Decentralized Trust Foundation (LFDT) are classified into stages of maturity.  
    The LFDT TOC uses these criteria to define project maturity:

- [Graduated](#graduated)
- [Incubating](#incubating)
- [Labs](#labs)
- [Non-code](#non-code)
- [Archived](#archived)

---

## Graduated

Graduated projects represent the most mature stage within the LFDT community.  
They have demonstrated sustained growth, active contributor engagement, production use cases, and strong governance practices.  
Graduation signals stability, broad adoption, and vendor-neutral stewardship.  
Learn more in the [Project Lifecycle](https://lf-decentralized-trust.github.io/governance/governing-documents/project-lifecycle/?h=lifecycle).

- [Hiero](https://hiero.org) – The LFDT project name for the Hedera codebase, now governed under vendor-neutral stewardship.
- [Hyperledger Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/) – An open-source Ethereum client under Apache 2.0, written in Java.
- [Hyperledger Cacti](https://hyperledger-cacti.github.io/cacti/) – A tool framework to securely integrate and coordinate different blockchain networks.
- [Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/) – A modular, permissioned blockchain framework for enterprise-grade distributed ledger solutions.
- [Hyperledger FireFly](https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/) – A “Supernode” stack enabling enterprises to build secure Web3 applications via APIs and orchestrated workflows.
- [Hyperledger Indy](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/indy) – A purpose-built distributed ledger for decentralized identities (DIDs).
- [Hyperledger Iroha](https://iroha.readthedocs.io/) – A simple, C++–based distributed ledger framework for digital asset management.

## Incubating

Incubating projects are actively growing within the LFDT community.  
They show clear promise and alignment with LFDT’s mission, with early contributor momentum.  
These projects are maturing toward wider adoption and stronger governance.  
Learn more in the [Project Lifecycle](https://lf-decentralized-trust.github.io/governance/governing-documents/project-lifecycle/?h=lifecycle).

- [Hyperledger AnonCreds](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds) – A verifiable credentials format commonly applied in identity systems.
- [Hyperledger Bevel](https://github.com/hyperledger-bevel/bevel) – A framework scaffolding enterprise blockchain deployments with best practices and automation.
- [Hyperledger Caliper](https://hyperledger-caliper.github.io/caliper/) – A benchmarking tool designed to measure performance across blockchain implementations.
- [CREDEBL](https://docs.credebl.id/) – A decentralized identity and verifiable credentials management platform.
- [Hyperledger Identus](https://hyperledger-identus.github.io/docs/) – Components and tools for building self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems.
- [Lockness](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/projects/lockness) – A toolkit ecosystem centered on key management and digital signature protocols.
- [Smoot](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/projects/smoot) – A modular interoperability framework supporting cross-blockchain communication.
- [Solang](https://solang.readthedocs.io/) – A Rust-based Solidity compiler targeting platforms such as Solana and Substrate.

## Labs

Labs are the earliest stage in the LFDT project lifecycle. They provide a safe space for experimentation, hackathon outputs, proofs of concept, and early demos. Projects in Labs may graduate into Incubating if they gain traction, or remain as reference experiments.  

More details about LFDT Labs (descriptions, repositories, stewards) are available at the [LFDT Labs GitHub](https://lf-decentralized-trust-labs.github.io/).

- **You can find a list to the [currently Active LFDT Labs here](https://lf-decentralized-trust-labs.github.io/labs/lfdt/).**

## Archived

Archived projects are no longer actively maintained within the LFDT community.   They may be inactive, superseded by other efforts, or simply reached end of life.   While their code and history remain available, they are not expected to evolve further.  

Learn more in the [Project Lifecycle](https://lf-decentralized-trust.github.io/governance/governing-documents/project-lifecycle/?h=lifecycle).

## Non-code

Not all contributions to LFDT involve code.  
Non-code contributions strengthen the ecosystem through documentation, community, and governance work.  
They play an essential role in supporting adoption, transparency, and contributor growth.  
Learn more in the [Project Lifecycle](https://lf-decentralized-trust.github.io/governance/governing-documents/project-lifecycle/?h=lifecycle).

- **Documentation Initiatives** – Guides, glossaries, walkthroughs that improve onboarding and usage.
- **Community Outreach** – Regional chapters, meetups, mailing lists, Discord, website content improvements.
- **Governance & Policy Documents** – Proposal templates, project charters, branding, guidelines, codes of conduct.


End-users are some of the most valuable contributors: by adopting LFDT projects in production, sharing feedback, and documenting real-world use cases, they strengthen the ecosystem just as much as code contributors do.
