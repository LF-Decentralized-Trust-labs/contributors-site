# Contribute to an Existing Project

If you’re here, you’re already part of the story. LFDT projects are built in the open by people who fix small things, ask good questions, write a paragraph of docs, or land their first PR. This page is a gentle on-ramp—pointing you to the right places so you can start contributing today, without wading through policy.

## Pick a project you’re excited about

Start with the **LFDT projects directory** and browse by area. On each project’s site or repo, look for three signals: a **CONTRIBUTING** guide (how to set up and submit changes), issue labels like **good first issue** or **help wanted**, and **communication channels** (chat, mailing list, community calls). That’s your starter kit.

## Make your first contribution

There’s no single “right” first step—pick the path that feels natural:

**Docs & tutorials.** Spot a confusing sentence? Fix it. Add a quick how-to based on something you just learned. Docs PRs are the fastest way to help others.

**Code & reviews.** Reproduce a bug, add a test, or tackle a small issue labeled for newcomers. If you’re unsure, leave a comment and ask for context.

**Community.** Join a call, share notes, or help triage issues. Good stewardship (welcoming, labeling, nudging) is as valuable as code.

*Tip: keep changes small at first. Small PRs get quick reviews and teach you the project’s style.*

## Ask for help (early and often)

You don’t need permission to start—but you should never feel stuck. Say hello in the project’s chat or list, ask for a pointer to good first issues, and attend an upcoming call if you want a quick gut-check on an idea.

- Mailing lists (TAC & project lists): <https://lists.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/g/tac/topics>
- Meeting calendar (community calls): <https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/meeting-calendar>

## Keep going

Once you’ve made a contribution, you’re part of the community. From there you can join a working group, sign up for mentorship, or help with releases and docs sprints. If you’re curious about how projects evolve under LFDT’s neutral governance, the **lifecycle** page shows the journey from Incubation to Graduation.
