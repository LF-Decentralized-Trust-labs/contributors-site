# üê£ Good First Issue Contribution Guidelines

This guide explains what qualifies as a ‚ÄúGood First Issue‚Äù, how to suggest new issues and how to participate by resolving good first issues.
All our good first issues should be labeled with the `good first issue` label.

## What is a Good First Issue?

A Good First Issue is a task that is suitable for newcomers to the project. It should be:

- **Well-defined**: The issue should have a clear goal and scope.
- **Manageable**: The task should be small enough to be completed in a reasonable amount of time (typically a few hours).
- **Educational**: The issue should help the newcomer learn about the project and its codebase.
- **Non-critical**: The issue should not involve critical functionality or complex dependencies.
- **Documented**: The issue should include all necessary information, such as links to relevant documentation, code examples, and any prerequisites.

Examples of Good First Issues:

- Documentation updates (typos, broken links, clarifying setup steps).
- Adding or improving tests for small, isolated components.
- Code style or linting improvements.
- Simple bug fixes with clear reproduction steps.
- Small feature enhancements (e.g., adding a config flag, improving log messages).
