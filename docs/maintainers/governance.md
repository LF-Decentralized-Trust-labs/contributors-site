# Governance Playbook

!!! Welcome
    Clear governance sustains project health and trust. Use these patterns to document roles, decisions, and succession.

## Roles & Ladder (MAINTAINERS.md)

  Contributor → Reviewer → Approver → Maintainer; expectations and promotion signals.

- **Contributor → Reviewer → Approver → Maintainer**
- Expectations: code quality, reviews, conduct, release participation
- Promotion: nomination, lazy consensus, objection window; document criteria

## Decision-Making & Dispute Resolution

  Lazy consensus for most changes; voting for breaking changes; TAC escalation patterns.

- **Lazy consensus** for routine changes
- **Documented voting** for breaking changes & elections
- **Escalation**: unresolved disputes summarized and sent to the **TAC**

## Subprojects & Repository Topology

  Propose, accept, and retire subprojects; OWNERS mapping per directory/repo.

- How to **propose a subproject**, maintainer expectations, acceptance criteria
- OWNERS/maintainers per directory or repo
- Deprecation/retirement path and communications

## Elections & Inactivity

  Cadence, eligibility, tie-breakers, and the LFDT inactivity/succession process.

- Election cadence, eligible voters, nomination windows, tie-breakers
- Follow LFDT **inactivity** policy for respectful transitions
- Maintain a public maintainers list with contact and terms (if applicable)

## Required Docs

- `GOVERNANCE.md` — decisions, roles, meetings, dispute resolution
- `MAINTAINERS.md` — names/handles, ladder, how to become a maintainer
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — link to LFDT or project CoC

## Checklists

- [ ] GOVERNANCE.md merged and discoverable
- [ ] MAINTAINERS.md with ladder + expectations
- [ ] Elections documented (if applicable)
- [ ] Inactivity/succession process linked
