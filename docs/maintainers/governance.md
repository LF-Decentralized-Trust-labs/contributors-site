# Governance Playbook

Clear governance sustains project health and trust.

## Roles & Ladder (MAINTAINERS.md)

- **Contributor → Reviewer → Approver → Maintainer** progression.
- Expectations: code quality, reviews, community conduct, release participation.
- Document nomination criteria and a promotion process (lazy consensus + objection window).

## Decision‑Making & Dispute Resolution

- Prefer **lazy consensus** for routine changes.
- Use documented voting for breaking changes and elections.
- Escalate unresolved disputes to the **TAC** with a short written summary of options considered.

## Subprojects & Repository Topology

- Describe how to **propose a subproject**, expected maintainers, and acceptance criteria.
- Keep clear OWNERS/maintainers per directory or repo.
- Publish a deprecation/retirement path for subprojects.

## Elections & Inactivity

- Define election cadence, eligible voters, nomination windows, and tie‑breakers.
- Follow LFDT **inactivity** policy for respectful transitions.
- Maintain a public list of current maintainers with contact method and terms if applicable.

## Required Docs

- `GOVERNANCE.md` — decision process, roles, meetings, dispute resolution.
- `MAINTAINERS.md` — names, roles, how to become one.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — link to LFDT or project CoC.
