# New Maintainer Onboarding (First 30 Days)

A concise path to a healthy, secure, and welcoming project.

## Week 1 — Foundations

- Ensure `GOVERNANCE.md`, `MAINTAINERS.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` exist and are linked from README.
- Set up labels and a triage schedule.
- Enable branch protections and required CI checks.

## Week 2 — Security & Releases

- Add `SECURITY.md` with a private contact and embargo process.
- Configure signed releases, provenance, and SBOM generation.
- Run OpenSSF Scorecard; capture baseline, fix high‑impact items.

## Week 3 — Community Routines

- Host or join a community call; publish notes.
- Tag and mentor `good first issue` items.
- Document PR review workflow and SLAs in CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Week 4 — Plan & Report

- Draft a 90‑day lightweight roadmap and post it.
- Publish a short **project update** (wins, risks, requests for help).
- Verify you meet LFDT required processes (updates, annual review, inactivity policy).
