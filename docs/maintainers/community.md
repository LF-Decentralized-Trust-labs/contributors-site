## PR Review & Triage Workflow

- **Labels:** `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `needs design`, `needs tests`, `blocked`
- **SLA targets:** Acknowledge within **2 business days**; decide (merge/request-changes) within **10 business days**
- **Flow:** Draft → CI green → Reviewer → Approver/Maintainer; require **1 reviewer + 1 approver** for risky changes
- **Merge policy:** Prefer squash merges; meaningful messages; reference issues

## Issue Triage Cadence

- Weekly triage (call or rotation)
- Confirm reproduction steps, owner, milestone
- Close stale issues with guidance; route newcomers to approachable items

## Running Inclusive Meetings

- Publish agenda 24h before; time-box topics
- Start with quick status; end with decisions + owners
- Capture notes/recordings and link from the repo
- Rotate facilitation and note-taking

## Contributor Growth & Mentorship

- Keep **CONTRIBUTING.md** minimal and actionable (env setup, quickstart, “how to get a review”)
- Tag `good first issue`; assign a **buddy** to first-time contributors
- Offer 2–4 week mentorship sprints around a feature or doc
- Recognize contributions in release notes and calls

## Vendor Neutrality & Communications

- Decisions based on technical merit and community impact
- Disclose conflicts of interest
- Prefer neutral channels/branding; avoid vendor-exclusive perks

## Checklists

- [ ] Labels defined and documented
- [ ] Triage rotation documented
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md with quickstart
- [ ] Meeting cadence + notes location documented
