# Community Playbook

Great projects grow great communities. Use these lightweight practices to keep contribution pathways clear and inclusive.

## PR Review & Triage Workflow

- **Labels:** Define `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `needs design`, `needs tests`, `blocked`.
- **SLA targets:** Aim to **acknowledge within 2 business days**; provide an outcome (merge/request‑changes) within 10 business days.
- **Review flow:** Draft → CI green → Reviewer → Approver/Maintainer. Require at least **1 reviewer + 1 approver** for risky changes.
- **Merge policy:** Prefer squash merges; keep commit messages meaningful; reference issues.

## Issue Triage Cadence

- Weekly triage call or async rotation.
- Confirm reproduction steps, scope, owner, and milestone.
- Close stale issues humanely; point newcomers to approachable items.

## Running Inclusive Meetings

- Publish an agenda 24h in advance; time‑box topics.
- Start with quick status, end with decisions and owners.
- Capture notes + recording; post links in the repo.
- Use a rotation for facilitation and note‑taking.

## Contributor Growth & Mentorship

- Keep a **CONTRIBUTING.md** with environment setup, quickstart, and “how to get a review.”
- Tag `good first issue`; assign a **buddy** for first‑time contributors.
- Offer short mentorship sprints (2–4 weeks) around a specific feature or doc.
- Recognize contributions in release notes and community calls.

## Vendor Neutrality & Communications

- Decisions are made on technical merit and community impact.
- Disclose potential conflicts of interest in governance discussions.
- Prefer neutral channels and branding; avoid vendor‑exclusive perks.
