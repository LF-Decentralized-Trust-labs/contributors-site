# Community Playbook

A concise playbook for maintainers to run healthy, welcoming communities: clear review flow, lightweight triage, inclusive meetings, growth pathways, and neutral communications.

!!! tip "Use small loops"
    Favor short, repeatable practices over heavy process. Publish decisions, welcome newcomers, and keep velocity high.

## PR Review & Triage Workflow

- **Labels:** `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `needs design`, `needs tests`, `blocked`
- **SLAs:** acknowledge within **2 business days**; decide (merge/request‑changes) within **10 business days**
- **Flow:** Draft → CI green → **Reviewer** → **Approver/Maintainer** (require 1 reviewer + 1 approver for risky changes)
- **Merge policy:** prefer **squash**; meaningful messages; reference issues

## Issue Triage Cadence

- Weekly triage (short call or rotating owner)  
- Confirm **repro steps**, **owner**, **milestone/label**  
- Route newcomers to approachable items; close stale issues with guidance

## Running Inclusive Meetings

- Publish agenda **24h** before; time‑box topics  
- Start with quick status; end with **decisions + owners**  
- Capture notes/recordings and link from the repo  
- Rotate **facilitator** and **note‑taker**

## Contributor Growth & Mentorship

- Keep `CONTRIBUTING.md` minimal and actionable (env setup, quickstart, “how to get a review”)  
- Tag **good‑first‑issues**; pair first‑timers with a **buddy reviewer**  
- Offer **2–4 week** mentorship sprints around a feature or doc  
- Recognize contributors in release notes and calls

## Vendor Neutrality & Communications

- Decisions based on **technical merit** and community impact  
- Disclose **conflicts of interest**  
- Prefer neutral channels/branding; avoid vendor‑exclusive perks
