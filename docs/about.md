# About

Welcome to the **LF Decentralized Trust (LFDT)** Contributor Guide — a one-stop guide to using, contributing to, and maintaining LFDT projects. This site collects contributor ladders, maintainer playbooks, governance templates, mentorship paths, and end-user contribution guidance under a single, vendor-neutral roof.

!!! tip "New here?"
    If you’re not sure where to start, visit **[Getting Started with Open Source at LFDT](./contribute/start.md)** or **[Contributing as an End User](./contribute/end-users.md)**. Adoption and feedback are high-impact contributions.

## Contributor Ladder Task Force

The **Contributor Ladder Task Force** (CLTF) stewards community health across LFDT by helping projects **build, scale, and retain** contributor communities. Our focus areas include people-centric governance, contributor experience, communications, operations, and the tools/processes that support them. We aim to help projects grow flourishing, sustainable communities throughout the LFDT project lifecycle.

**What we do**
- Publish guidance on contributor ladders, roles, and pathways
- Offer best practices for governance and project operations
- Coach projects on community growth, recognition, and retention
- Maintain resources and templates that projects can copy and adapt

> Want to collaborate with the CLTF? Open an issue or PR on this site, or reach out via the LFDT community channels listed in project docs.
> Join our CLTF weekly meetings {insert link to LFX Calendar listing for CLFT mtg}

## How to Contribute to These Docs

We welcome improvements! Typical edits include adding examples, clarifying steps, or contributing new pages.

1. **Edit or propose a page** via GitHub (use the “Edit this page” link if available).  
2. If your content isn’t ready for prime time, mark it as a draft by adding `draft: true` in the page front matter.  
3. Open a Pull Request; a preview build will validate your changes.
