# Join the Mentorship Program

Curious about decentralized tech and want a hand getting started? Join the LFDT Mentorship Program. We match you with maintainers who will help you pick a project, break it into doable steps, and celebrate your wins. You'll collaborate in the open, grow through regular reviews, and showcase your progress, whether that's a short blog post, a lightning talk, or a conference presentation. Come learn, contribute, and find your place in the LFDT community.
